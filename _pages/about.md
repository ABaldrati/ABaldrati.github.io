Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am Alberto Baldrati, a third-year PhD student enrolled in the AI Italian National Doctorate program based at the [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english]).
In practice, I am hosted by the [University of Florence](https://www.unifi.it/changelang-eng.html) and work at the [Media Integration and Communication Center (MICC)](https://www.micc.unifi.it/) under the supervision of Prof. [Marco Bertini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SBm9ZpYAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Andrew David Bagdanov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_Fk4YUcAAAAJ&hl=en).

In addition to my academic work, I had the valuable opportunity to intern as a Computer Vision Research Scientist at [Huawei Finland Research Center](https://huaweifinlandrnd.teamtailor.com/), focusing on video generation from March to September 2024. I will be submitting my PhD thesis by the end of October 2024, with my defense scheduled for February 2025.

<!-- I also closely collaborate with [Lorenzo Agnolucci](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hsCt4ZAAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Davide Morelli](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UJ4D3rYAAAAJ&hl=en). -->

<!-- Previously, I obtained my MSc in Computer Science and Engineering <em>magna cum laude</em> at the University of Florence under the supervision of Prof. [Marco Bertini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SBm9ZpYAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Alberto Del Bimbo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bf2ZrFcAAAAJ&hl=en) with a thesis titled <em>"Deep Learning techniques for image retrieval using joint textual and visual encoders"</em>. -->

My main research interests revolve around <strong>vision and language</strong>, with a particular focus on prompt learning and composed image retrieval, and <strong>fashion image generation</strong>, with a particular focus on multimodal fashion image editing and virtual try-on.

<!-- Currently interning as a Computer Vision Research Scientist at [Huawei Finland Research Center](https://huaweifinlandrnd.teamtailor.com/). -->
